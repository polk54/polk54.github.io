    Sanitation Access: A Randomized Control Trial
  </div>
  <div id= "projectContent">
      For my master's capstone project, I designed a randomized control trial (RCT) to evaluate three sanitation interventions in Bihar, India. <br>
      <br> Previous sanitation studies found that building improved sanitation facilities did not neccessarily result in improved health outcomes for populations in rural India.
      However, those studies are limited to monitoring <font color="#0AB26D"> access </font> to these facilities rather than <font color="#0AB26D">use</font>. <br>
      <br> Often times, these facilities are not well maintained and the design combats the population's social norms.
      So, rather than looking at access to sanitation, my RCT proposed measuring the <font color="#0AB26D">use</font> of improved sanitation facilities and how that affects health outcomes.
      <br> <br>
      The figure below shows my hypothesized causal pathway, starting with my three interventions and their underlying principles.

      <br>
      I measured <font color="#0AB26D">use</font> through adoption rates and health outcomes (specifically rates of reported diarrhea and soil-transmitted helminth infections).
      The interventions were based on changing collective behavior and/or developing facilities tailored to user preferences. <br>
      <br> One of my interventions, which used human-centered design principles, earned me a spot as a finalist in the San Diego Social Innovation Competition.
